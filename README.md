# balloon_detection
A tensorflow/keras convolutional neural network model for speech balloon segmentation in comics.

For details see Dubray and Laubrock (arXiv preprint),
[Deep CNN-based Speech Balloon Detection and Segmentation for Comic Books](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08137).

The model was trained and compiled on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS with tensorflow 1.12.
